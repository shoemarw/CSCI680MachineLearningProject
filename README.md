# CSCI680MachineLearningProject
This is a repository for our term project for csci 680 topics in computer science: machine learning. 
In this project we investigate the effect of learning rates for linear regression with gradient descent. 
We use the house price data set from Kaggle.


The python files are described in the write up. To run experiments just go into predictor.py and change the contents of
the arrays to have the desired learning rates, decay rates, and epochs. Then run the program. Make sure train.csv is
in the directory that predictor.py is. After the program runs csv files will appear in the directory. The csv files
contain the experimental results.
